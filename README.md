# 🌱 Cultivating optimal crop yields with machine learning! ☀️
## Description
### -This a a machine learning model that i made which provides the best suitable crop to grow based on many factors such as potassium, nitrogen, pH levels etc 
### -Employed various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest etc to predict the most suitable crop for given environmental factors
